      <p>
        As of 2022, there are 5.1 billion Internet users. Technology is all around us. We use it for everyday tasks, and it is constantly evolving. It has become a necessity.
        The new generations will have a massive advantage if they have programming and computer knowledge. 
        What if you could help prepare your kids for the new era?
        The Coding learning center is a fun place with a safe environment where kids can learn Coding from experts.
        What is coding? According to google, coding is the process or activity of writing computer programs.
        Coding allows humans to create computer software, games, apps and websites, 
        and everything behind what we see and interact with on a computer, tablet, or phone. 
        Coding is creating instructions for computers on what actions to perform
        We can also say that Coding is how humans communicate with computers. Coding is part of programming, 
        which is developing computer software like programs, operating systems, and mobile applications.
        At The Coding Learning Center we make un ways to learn to code. 
        We believe in the love for learning, and we want kids to love learning, and we believe they can be leaders and creators instead of consumers.

      <h3>Programs</h3>
      <p>
        Beginners
        Very visual, fun, and easy to understand. Kids start working on storytelling and game design using apps like code spark academy, gamestar mechanic and scratch. At this point, the kid must always be in the line of sight of the instructor and often has questions. The instructor guides the children step by step. This stage is a crucial time to cultivate a love for learning.
        
        Intermediates
        At this point, the instructor switches to being a supervisor: They let the children work more independently, but reassures them and keep monitoring them in case they need rescuing. The apps being use are CodeCombat, scratch, codeMoji, in others. Children learn javascript and LUA.
        
        Masters
        Children are sufficiently capable of dealing with edge cases themselves, becoming autonomous enough in creating games, coding, and programming. Kids learn C# and Python.
        
        Facts
        Problem-solving is a crucial skill to have. When children learn to code, it helps them develop problem-solving and essential skills such as logic, critical thinking, and STEM skills.
        While learning to code, children are encouraged to think critically and strategically to solve problems. Visual blocks are often used for younger children to represent programming concepts and terminology.
        Kids who code often have higher grades than other children.
